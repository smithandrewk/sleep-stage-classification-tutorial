# Contributing

## Learning Path
1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the challenge or tutorial in the respective notebook or document.
2. **Implement**: Attempt to solve the problem on your own or in collaboration.
3. **Review**: Submit your work through pull requests, and we'll review it together.

## Guidelines
- Write clean, commented code. Explain your thought process in comments.
- Use pseudocode when unsure about implementation details.
- Test your code before submitting (we'll provide tests for you to pass).

## Pull Requests
- Fork the repo, make your changes, commit, push to your fork, then create a PR from your fork's branch to our `development` branch.
- Describe what you've learned and any challenges faced.

## Code Review
We'll review your code for conceptual correctness, efficiency, and adherence to the learning objectives, not just for passing tests.
